# Adding a post

Add a post to the `_posts` directory follwing the naming format (TBD -- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). We might want to put posts in individual directories so that they can be packaged with custom css and js.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Features to add

I'd like to add either full-text search (e.g., [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/)) or fuzzy searching on the tags (e.g., [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io/)).

We should also look at the themes found [here](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/jekyll-theme-showcase-share-your-jekyll-themes/1382/15), [here](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme), and [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes).
