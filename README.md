# Adding a post

Add a post to the `_posts` directory follwing the naming format (TBD). We might want to put posts in individual directories so that they can be packaged with custom css and js.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
